## Additional Enhancements

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Role-based Access**: Ensure actions are restricted based on the user role.
- **Secure Login**: Implement secure password handling (e.g., hashing).

### Data Validation

- **Input Validation**: Validate all input data to ensure consistency and integrity.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure that the removal of users does not orphan related data (e.g., grades without students).

### Reporting & Analytics

- **Generate Reports**: Admins can generate performance reports for students and subjects.
- **Dashboard Analytics**: Admin dashboard displays key metrics (e.g., average grades, number of students per subject).

### Notifications

- **Email Alerts**: Send notifications to users (e.g., new grades for students, changes in subjects for trainers).

### User Experience

- **User-friendly UI**: Design an intuitive interface for all user roles.

## MVC Design Implementation

### Models

#### User Model

- **Attributes**: `username`, `password`, `role`, etc.
- **Methods**: `authenticate`, `add_user`, `remove_user`, etc.

#### Student Model

- **Attributes**: `name`, `subjects`, `grades`, etc.
- **Methods**: `get_subjects`, `get_grades`, etc.

#### Subject Model

- **Attributes**: `subject_name`, `students_enrolled`, etc.
- **Methods**: `assign_student`, `get_students`, etc.

#### Grade Model

- **Attributes**: `student`, `subject`, `grade`, etc.
- **Methods**: `add_grade`, `update_grade`, etc.

### Views

- **Login View**: Form for user login.
- **Admin Dashboard View**: Interface for managing users, subjects, and generating reports.
- **Trainer Dashboard View**: Interface for managing students and subjects.
- **Student Dashboard View**: Interface for viewing subjects and grades.

### Controllers

- **AuthController**: Handles login, logout, and session management.
- **AdminController**: Manages admin-specific actions like adding/removing users and assigning subjects.
- **TrainerController**: Manages trainer-specific actions like viewing students and subjects, and assigning grades.
- **StudentController**: Manages student-specific actions like viewing subjects and grades.

## Example Exception Handling Scenarios

- **Admin Attempts to Remove Themselves**: Notify that admins cannot remove themselves and suggest to transfer rights first.
- **Trainer Assigns Grade to Non-Enrolled Student**: Notify that the student is not enrolled in the subject.
- **Student Accesses Grades with No Subjects Assigned**: Notify that no subjects are currently assigned and suggest contacting the admin.

## Next Steps

1. **Design Database Schema**: Outline tables and relationships for storing users, subjects, grades, etc.
2. **Develop Models**: Implement data handling and business logic.
3. **Create Views**: Design user interfaces for different roles.
4. **Build Controllers**: Handle interactions between users, views, and models.
